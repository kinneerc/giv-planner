Terminal (OSX, Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).
Launching the Terminal/Command Prompt will put you in your home directory.
After launching Terminal/Command Prompt, you will need to navigate to
the `giv-planner-master` directory. This will depend on where you chose
to relocate the tool in the previous step.
